This github is so we can have a centralized location for our code. We are creating a rubik cube solver


combine.py is a GUI to help the user put in the colors of their cube.

CamColor.py will let the user scan their rubik cube and it will output a string that will be placed in CubeAlgorithm.py to give the steps to complete the cube
